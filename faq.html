                    <h2>Which platforms does the Dragon Gaming support?</h2>
                    <span>The Epic Games Store currently offers PC and Mac support. You can check platform compatibility
                        for individual titles by referring to the “About Game” section of any product page.

                    <span>You can find upcoming features, developer updates, and major known issues on our Epic Games
                        Store Roadmap on Trello. We’ll also share significant updates with you on our news feed and
                        social media pages such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube.

                    <h2>Why does the Dragon Gaming make exclusivity deals?</h2>
                    <span>
                        <p>
                            Exclusives are a part of the growth of many successful platforms for games and for other
                            forms
                            of digital entertainment, such as streaming video and music.
                        </p>

                        <p>Epic works in partnership with developers and publishers to offer games exclusively on the
                            store. In exchange for exclusivity, Epic provides them with financial support for
                            development
                            and marketing, which enables them to build more polished games with significantly less
                            uncertainty for the creators.</p>

                        <p>In addition, creators will earn 88% of all the revenue from their game, while most stores
                            only
                            offer 70%.</p>

                    <h2>What is the Support-A-Creator program? </h2>
                    <span>The Support-A-Creator program enables content Creators to earn money from games in the Epic
                        Games Store by using Creator Links and Creator Tags. Learn more about the Support-A-Creator
                        program here.

                    <h2>What’s this about free games?</h2>
                    <span>Epic will be offering a new free game available each week throughout 2022. When you claim a
                        free game, it’s yours to keep - even after the game is no longer available to new customers for
                        free.

                    <h2>I claimed a free game but don’t see it on my account now, why?</h2>
                    <span>Once you claim a free game, it’s yours to keep. If you come back later and don’t see it your
                        account, please check to see if you have multiple accounts. If you created an Epic account using
                        an @gmail.com email address, log in to it directly using your Gmail password; using the Google
                        login button will create a distinct account even if it’s tied to the same @gmail.com email
                        address. And check to see if you have both a console-linked account (logging in via PlayStation,
                        Xbox, or Nintendo account) and a separate Epic account. If you still encounter issues, please
                        contact player support here.

                    <h2>Can I try a game before I buy it?</h2>
                    <span>Some publishers occasionally offer demos or free trial periods for certain non-free games from
                        time to time (for example, a Free Weekend trial). During a free trial period, you can download
                        and play a trial version of the game before you decide to purchase, but you can no longer access
                        the game when the trial period ends.

                    <h2>How do refunds work on the Epic Games Store?</h2>
                    <span>All games are eligible for refund within 14 days of purchase for any reason, as long as you’ve
                        had the game running for less than 2 hours. You will not be eligible for refunds for games from
                        which you have been banned or for which you have otherwise violated the Terms of Service. Learn

                            Engine. This account system has never been compromised. However, specific individual Epic
                            accounts have been compromised by hackers using lists of email addresses and passwords
                            leaked
                            from other sites which have been compromised.</p>

                        <p>If you use the same email address and password on Epic as you used on another site which has
                            been compromised, then your account is vulnerable to attack. To secure your Epic account,
                            use a
                            unique password, and enable multi-factor authentication. You can learn more about the
                            measures
                            we take to protect your account and what you can do to stay safe here.</p>
